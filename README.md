Komodo Roguelike Blockchain Game is a remake of the original ‘Rogue’ which was a dungeon crawling video game by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman and later contributions by Ken Arnold. Rogue was originally developed around 1980 for Unix-based mainframe systems as a freely-distributed executable. It was later included in the official Berkeley Software Distribution 4.2 operating system.

The new iteration of the old classic will allow players to create a unique avatar, represented by a non-fungible token on the Komodo platform with unique blockchain gaming histories, which they can later collect and trade.

It is the world’s first project utilizing non-fungible tokens combined with our Cryptoconditions (CC) technology. As a result, your avatar can earn in-game gold which can be easily transferred into real coins (= blockchain based cryptocurrency units).
